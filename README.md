# Object Oriented Programming
Keynotes and Question Answers for 
Semester-End Exam 
Module I: Introduction (10%) 
Key Topics: 
1. Difference between C and C++: 
C is a procedural programming language that follows a top-down approach, whereas C++ is 
an object-oriented programming language that follows the bottom-up approach and 
supports features like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc. C does not support data 
abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance; C++ supports all these features. 

2. Procedure-Oriented vs Object-Oriented Approach: 
Procedure-Oriented: Focuses on functions and operations. Example: C. Object-Oriented: 
Focuses on objects that have both data and methods. Example: C++. 

3. Basic Concepts: 
Objects: Instances of a class that hold data and can perform operations. 
Classes: Templates or blueprints for creating objects. 
Abstraction: Hiding unnecessary details to focus on relevant information. 
Encapsulation: Bundling the data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit 
(class). 
Inheritance: Mechanism where a new class acquires properties of an existing class. 
Polymorphism: Ability of an object to take many forms. Can be achieved through method 
overloading or overriding. 
Dynamic Binding: Method calls are resolved at runtime. 
Message Passing: Objects communicate by sending messages (calling methods). 

4. Characteristics of Object-Oriented Languages: 
Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, dynamic binding, and message 
passing are the key characteristics of OOP. 




Module II: Classes & Objects (25%) 
Key Topics: 
1. Abstract Data Types: Data types that are defined by the programmer, encapsulating 
data and operations on that data. 

2. Object and Classes: 
Object: An instance of a class. Class: A blueprint that defines attributes (data) and methods 
(functions). 

3. C++ Class Declaration: 
class ClassName { 
public:  
// data members 
// member functions  
}; 

4. Local and Global Classes: 
Local Class: Defined within a function. 
Global Class: Defined outside of any function. 

5. State, Identity, and Behaviour of an Object: 
State: The values of an objectâ€™s attributes. 
Identity: A unique identifier for the object. 
Behaviour: The functions (methods) an object can perform. 

6. Scope Resolution Operator (::): Used to define methods outside the class definition. 

7. Friend Functions: Functions that can access the private and protected members of a 
class. 

8. Inline Functions: Functions defined with the inline keyword to reduce function call 
overhead. 

9. Constructors and Destructors: 
Constructor: Initializes an object when it is created. 
Destructor: Cleans up when an object goes out of scope. 

10. Static Class Data: Class data shared by all objects of the class. 

11. Array of Objects: Arrays that can hold multiple objects of a class. 

12. Constant Member Functions: Functions that do not modify the state of the object. 

13. Memory Management Operators: new and delete operators for dynamic memory 
allocation and deallocation. 







Module III: Inheritance (20%) 
Key Topics: 
1. Inheritance: Mechanism where a class derives properties and behaviors from another 
class. 

2. Types of Inheritance: 
Single Inheritance: One base class and one derived class. 
Multiple Inheritance: A derived class inherits from multiple base classes. 
Multilevel Inheritance: A class inherits from a derived class. 
Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class. 

3. Access Modes: 
Public: Members are accessible from outside the class. 
Private: Members are not accessible from outside. 
Protected: Members are accessible in derived classes. 

4. Abstract Classes: Classes that cannot be instantiated and contain at least one pure 
virtual function. 

5. Ambiguity Resolution: Resolved using scope resolution operator or virtual base class. 

6. Aggregation and Composition: 
Aggregation: 'Has-a' relationship, weak association. 
Composition: Strong association, where the lifetime of the contained object depends on the 
lifetime of the container object. 

7. Overriding Inherited Methods: Redefining base class methods in the derived class. 

8. Constructors in Derived Classes: Constructors of derived classes call base class 
constructors. 

9. Nesting of Classes: Defining a class inside another class. 









Module IV: Polymorphism (20%) 
Key Topics: 
1. Polymorphism: Ability of a function or an object to take many forms. 
Compile-time Polymorphism: Resolved during compilation (e.g., function overloading, 
operator overloading). 
Runtime Polymorphism: Resolved during runtime (e.g., virtual functions). 

2. Function Overloading: Multiple functions with the same name but different parameters. 

3. Operator Overloading: Redefining the way operators work for user-defined types. 

4. Polymorphism by Parameter: Same function name with different parameters. 

5. Pointer to Objects: Pointers that can point to objects of a class. 

6. This Pointer: Pointer that points to the current object. 

7. Virtual Functions: Functions in base class that can be overridden in derived class to 
support dynamic dispatch. 

8. Pure Virtual Functions: Virtual functions that do not have a definition in the base class 
and must be implemented by derived classes. 






Module V: Strings, Files, and Exception Handling (25%) 
Key Topics: 
1. Manipulating Strings: Functions such as strlen(), strcpy(), strcat(), strcmp() for 
handling C-style strings, and std::string for C++ string handling. 

2. Streams and File Handling: 
ifstream: Used for reading files. 
ofstream: Used for writing files. 
fstream: Used for both reading and writing files. 

3. Formatted and Unformatted I/O: 
Formatted: cin, cout with format specifiers. 
Unformatted: get(), put() for raw data input and output. 

4. Exception Handling: 
try, catch, throw: Used to handle exceptions and errors. 
Standard Exceptions: std::exception, std::runtime_error, etc. 

5. Generic Programming: 
Function Template: Template to create generic functions. 
Class Template: Template to create generic classes. 

6. Standard Template Library (STL): 
Containers: vector, list, set, map, etc. 
Algorithms: Sorting, searching, etc. 
Iterators: Used to traverse containers. 
Other STL Elements: Allocators, function objects, etc.
